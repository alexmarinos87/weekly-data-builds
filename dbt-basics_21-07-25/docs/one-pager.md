# Week 2 – dbt Basics

## Problem
Operational data is too raw for analytics. We need to transform it into a clean, queryable schema.

##  Goal
Use dbt to model raw `orders` and `customers` into a star schema (`dim_customers`, `fct_orders`), with tests and documentation.

##  Scope
- Seed CSVs: `orders.csv`, `customers.csv`
- Staging models: `stg_orders`, `stg_customers`
- Marts: `fct_orders`, `dim_customers`
- Tests: `not_null`, `unique`, `relationships`
- Docs: generate with `dbt docs`

## Success Criteria
- All models run with `dbt run`
- Tests pass with `dbt test`
- Lineage graph shows `ref()` chain
- Docs served via `dbt docs serve`
- Coverage >90%, all models documented

##  Assumptions
- Local Postgres + `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` available
- Using dbt v1.8+, Python 3.12
